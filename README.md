**Sthir** can create *memory efficient* search feature for your static website. Sthir is equipped with an *user friendly command-line interface*. In two steps you can build a working search page for your website!

## Description
Sthir is a library to create search functionality for your static websites. It scans your `html` pages for words and indexes these words in an efficient data structure called **Spectral Bloom Filters**. Spectral Bloom Filteres differs from regular ones as they can store counts for each hash (it can estimate, at minimum, how many times a hash was indexed). We are using an efficient base 15 decoding to compress and transfer the bloom filters at client side. Our goal can be described with a simple equation:

`Less Memory Footprint + Term Frequency Knowledge = Perfect Search Functionality for Static Sites!`

*A deployed example of our library can be found on [this blog](https://pncnmnp.github.io/blogs/search.html).*

## Installation

sthir runs on Python 3.5 or above.

Installation with [pip via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sthir/) for Linux, OS X and Windows:
```sh
pip install sthir
```
To check installation run the following command:
```sh
sthir -h
```
If you see the help messages without any error then the installation was successful.

## Quickstart

### Help message:
```
usage: sthir [-h] [-e ErrorRate] [-s Counter_size] [-l] [-ds] path

Creates a Spectral Bloom filter(SBF) for .html files in the specified
directory.

positional arguments:
  path             Path to source directory for creating the filter

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -e ErrorRate     Error_rate for the filter Range:[0.0,1.0] Default:0.01
  -s Counter_size  Size in bits of each counter in filter Range:[1,10]
                   Default:4(recommended)
  -l, --lemmetize  Enable Lemmetization
  -ds              Disable stopword removal from files (not recommended)
```

### Basic

To scan your HTML files and generate a static search webpage, use the command:
`sthir <your-path-name>`

By default, a `search.html` file, containing the static search functionality will be generated.

### Error rate
You can change the error rate of the generated Spectral Bloom Filter using:
`sthir <your-path-name> -e <error-rate>`

We recommend an error rate of `0.01`. Having a high error rate is likely to produce more false positive results (i.e. it will recommend URLs which do not contain the search word(s)).

### Counter size
By default, our counters can have a maximum count of 16 (`counter_size=4`). Counters are used by Spectral Bloom Filters to keep track of the number of times a particular hash has been indexed in the bloom filter. So by default, we keep a count till 16. However, you can chnage the counter size using: `sthir <your-path-name> -s <counter-size>`.

**Note:** 
* `counter_size` of `x` can store upto a maximum count `2^x`. For example: `counter_size` of 3, has a maximum count of `2^3` or `8`.
* As Spectral Bloom Filters are a **probabilistic** data structure, they cannot be used to accurately determine the upper bound of each word's hashes. They keep a track of the lower bound of a word's hashes (primarily using *Minimum Increment* method).
